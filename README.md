# Load-Balancer-System-Design-

A load balancer is a critical component in modern distributed 
systems and web architecture. Its primary function is to 
distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, 
ensuring reliability, scalability, and optimal resource 
utilization. 


1. What is a Load Balancer? 
A load balancer acts as an intermediary between clients and 
backend servers. It receives client requests, determines the 
most suitable server to handle each request, and forwards it 
accordingly. This prevents any single server from becoming a 
bottleneck or failing under heavy traffic. 


2. Importance of Load Balancers - High Availability: Load balancers detect server failures and 
reroute traffic to healthy servers, ensuring minimal downtime. - Scalability: They enable horizontal scaling by distributing 
workloads across additional servers as demand grows. - Performance Optimization: Load balancers distribute requests 
evenly, preventing server overload and reducing response 
times. 
- Security: By acting as a gateway, they can block malicious 
traffic, enforce SSL/TLS encryption, and protect against DDoS 
attacks. 


3. Types of Load Balancers 
1. Hardware Load Balancers: - Dedicated physical devices. - High performance but expensive and less flexible. 
2. Software Load Balancers: - Software applications deployed on standard hardware or 
virtualized environments. - Flexible, cost-effective, and widely used. 
3. Cloud Load Balancers: - Provided as a service by cloud providers like AWS, Azure, 
or Google Cloud. - Fully managed, highly scalable, and integrates with cloud 
ecosystems. 


4. Load Balancing Algorithms - Round Robin: Distributes requests sequentially among 
servers. - Least Connections: Directs traffic to the server with the 
fewest active connections. 
- Weighted Round Robin: Allocates traffic based on server 
capacity or weight. - IP Hashing: Routes requests based on client IP address for 
session persistence. 



5. Features of Load Balancers - Health Monitoring: Periodically checks server health and 
routes traffic away from unresponsive servers. - SSL Termination: Offloads SSL/TLS decryption, reducing 
server overhead. - Session Persistence: Ensures requests from a client are 
directed to the same server. - Auto-Scaling Integration: Automatically adjusts server pools 
based on demand. 


6. Use Cases - Web Applications: Handles high traffic websites and ensures 
uptime. - APIs: Manages API traffic for microservices architecture. - Media Streaming: Distributes high bandwidth requests for 
video and audio. 



7. Challenges and Best Practices - Proper Configuration: Misconfigurations can lead to uneven 
traffic distribution. - Monitoring: Regularly monitor load balancer performance to 
identify bottlenecks. - Scaling: Ensure adequate backend server capacity for 
unexpected traffic surges.
